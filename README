NAME
    RT::Extension::Nagios - Merge and resolve Nagios tickets

DESCRIPTION

    Used to merge and resolve Nagios tickets automatically.
    Based on http://wiki.bestpractical.com/view/AutoCloseOnNagiosRecoveryMessages,
    thanks, Todd Chapman!

INSTALLATION

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make install
        make initdb # first time only

    with RT 3.8 or later, you need to update "Plugins" configuration:

        Set( @Plugins, qw(... RT::Extension::Nagios) );

    below are the extra options:
    (check out lib/RT/Extension/Nagios.pm if you are confused):

        Set($NagiosSearchAllQueues, 1);
        Set($NagiosMergeTickets, 0); # false, don't merge
        Set($NagiosMergeTickets, 1); # merge into the newest ticket.
        Set($NagiosMergeTickets, -1); # merge into the oldest ticket.
        Set($NagiosResolvedStatus, "resolved");
        Set($NagiosResolveTickets, 0) # don't resolve tickets on recovery, just merge (maybe)
        Set($NagiosResolveTickets, 1) # Default, resolve tickets on recovery
